## 🧠 Our mission

ARPC conducts **independent, rigorous research** on agricultural risk management and farm safety-net programs to:

- analyze how policies function in real-world conditions  
- identify gaps and areas for improvement  
- provide evidence-based insights to enhance program effectiveness  
- help sustain farm income, strengthen rural communities, and stabilize markets  

We do **not advocate for specific policies**. Instead, our work equips decision-makers with unbiased analysis to evaluate potential reforms and understand their economic implications.
